Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India
Project Overview

The Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India project aims to address the pressing need for accurate predictions of crop production in India, leveraging advanced data science techniques. By analyzing historical data and employing predictive modeling algorithms, the objective is to develop a robust framework for estimating crop yields, thereby aiding farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions.

Problem Statement

Agriculture is one of the main sources of income in India. There is a need to improve the sustainability of agriculture due to the increasing rate of farmer suicides resulting from crop failures, low yields, and losses. This project revolves around predicting the yield of crops considering different climatic conditions in India and various attributes. The goal is to help farmers choose suitable crops to grow in order to achieve the required yield and profit. The need for crop yield prediction is essential for selecting the right crop, especially in the current scenario.

Proposed Solution

Despite rapid technological advancements in various sectors, the agriculture sector remains vulnerable to challenges such as unpredictable weather patterns, soil quality issues, fluctuating rainfall, and natural disasters. These factors often lead to crop failures, reduced production, and food shortages, posing significant economic and humanitarian obstacles.

Acknowledging the urgency to tackle these pressing issues, our proposed system aims to provide a viable solution by accurately predicting crop yield rates. Through the utilization of cutting-edge techniques and consideration of influential parameters such as the cost of cultivation (A2+FL and C2) and the cost of production, our system endeavors to identify the yield of crops in Quintal/Hectare. This proactive approach empowers farmers to anticipate risks, optimize cultivation practices, and maximize crop yield production, thereby mitigating the adverse impacts of crop failures and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

Modules

Crop Yield Prediction
This module returns the predicted yield of crops (Quintal/Hectare) based on user input. If the user wants to know the yield of a particular crop, the system takes the crop, state, cost of cultivation (A2+FL, C2), and cost of production as inputs and returns the predicted yield of the crop as output.

How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Run the application.
4. Input the required parameters (crop, state, cost of cultivation, cost of production).
5. Receive the predicted yield of the crop.
